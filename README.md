# DiabloWeb-Beta

DiabloWeb-Beta is a branch of the original Diablo Web project designed for experimental builds and new feature testing before stable release. The aim is to explore advanced functionality, handle edge cases, and optimize performance, all while staying true to the core Diablo experience in a browser-based environment.

## Purpose

The `diabloweb-beta` project allows developers and users to test new features, improvements, and fixes before they are integrated into the main [Diablo Web](https://github.com/JohnImril/diablo_web) repository. This sandbox provides an isolated environment for development and debugging, ensuring that changes are thoroughly vetted before they go live.

## Key Features

-   **Advanced Testing**: Includes new features, experimental builds, and advanced configurations.
-   **Early Access to Features**: Test upcoming updates before they are finalized in the main release.
-   **Cutting-Edge Performance**: Continuously optimizing the performance for modern browsers and mobile devices.
-   **Enhanced Debugging**: With detailed logging and testing features to identify potential issues.
-   **Compatibility with Node 22 and Beyond**: As the baseline for newer Node.js versions, this branch helps ensure the project runs seamlessly on the latest development environments.

## Usage

### How to Use

The beta branch can be useful for developers or contributors who want to:

1. **Test Features**: Get access to the latest, sometimes experimental, features.
2. **Contribute**: Developers can contribute bug fixes or suggest new features through pull requests on this branch.
3. **Explore**: Experiment with Diablo 1 in the browser while helping identify bugs or performance bottlenecks.
